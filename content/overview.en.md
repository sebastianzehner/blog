## Overview: What you'll find on my blog

My blog now includes a number of pages in several languages. To make the knowledge easily accessible and navigation as simple as possible, you will now find an **overview of my blog** and its content on this page.

## Day and night

Do you prefer a light or dark view of the blog?

You can click on either the sun or the moon in the top left menu to switch between the different views.

## The available languages

| [![German](/img/icons8-deutschland-96.png)](/de/overview/) | [![English](/img/icons8-usa-96.png)](/overview/) | [![Spanish](/img/icons8-spanien-2-96.png)](/es/overview/) |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |

German, English and Spanish.

You can click on the flags here to display the blog in the corresponding language. At the top left of the menu you will also find the links for the languages.

For each blog article, you can also click on the relevant language below the headline and after translations to stay directly on the current page.

## The search function

There is also a [search function](/search/) at the top of the menu, which allows you to find the content of the blog.

## The main menu

I want to keep the menu clear. Therefore, there are only the following menu items:

- [Start](/)
- [Overview](/overview/)
- [About me](/about/)
- [Search](/search/)

## The further subpages

You are now on the **Overview** page and from there you can access all the other subpages of my blog:

- [Categories](/categories/)
- [Tags](/tags/)
- [Archive](/archives/)
- Livecam (temporarily not available)
- [Newsletter](/newsletter/)
- Series (not yet available)

## These three categories

I currently only divide my blog articles into the following three categories. By clicking on the category, you can filter my blog articles accordingly.

- [Camping](/categories/camping/)
- [Paraguay](/categories/paraguay/)
- [Tech](/categories/tech/)

## My tags recommendations

You can find all tags [here](/tags/) but the most important ones are listed in the following section:

- [Motorhome](/tags/motorhome/)
- [El Paraiso Verde](/tags/el-paraiso-verde/)
- [Website](/tags/website/)

I hope you enjoy browsing through my blog and check back regularly or subscribe to the entire [newsfeed](/posts/index.xml) or that of a [category](/categories/) or a [tag](/tags/). To do this, click on the corresponding symbol next to the headings.

Best regards Sebastian
