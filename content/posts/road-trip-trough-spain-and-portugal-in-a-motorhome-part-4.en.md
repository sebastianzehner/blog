Today I'm writing the last part of our motorhome road trip through Spain and Portugal. The end in France was more like a vacation, as we stayed at the same campsite for a long time.

In the meantime, we were already back in Germany. Nevertheless, I don't want to withhold the last part from you. First and foremost, I'll continue with a new [series](/tags/emigrate/) on my blog.

We left earlier than planned from *Camping Torre la Sal 2* and received a refund accordingly, but this campsite was simply too busy and too touristy for us, and ultimately this place had nothing to offer in terms of the landscape. It is still a mystery to me what attracts people there.

## The last campsite in Spain

We therefore drove on to the next and last campsite in Spain called *Bella Terra*. We liked it there even more, the pitch wasn't quite as nice but there was a large playground nearby. The sanitary blocks were well equipped and clean. There was a modern swimming pool and you could go to the beach.

There were a few stores outside the campsite and a Consum supermarket a little further away but still within walking distance. After three days we drove on again because a storm with heavy rain was forecast in Spain. As it turned out later, this was a very good decision, as the media were talking about high water and flooding.

## The last stage in France

We arranged to meet our former neighbors in France at a campsite and drove to *Camping Nouvelle Floride* for another six days. It later turned out that they were at the campsite next door, as they unfortunately gave us the wrong name. However, this wasn't a big deal as the three campsites on the spot belong together and you have access to all three and can use the swimming pools. We did a few things together and had a great time. The area is again rather touristy and crowded with vacationers, but it was fine.

Afterwards, we wanted to meet up with Stefanie's sister and brother-in-law somewhere in France and spend their vacation together. We looked at a few campsites where dogs are also allowed on the beach. In the end, they joined us and we drove a little further to *Camping Beach Garden*, which is also part of the *Camping Les Méditerrannées* network.

However, this campsite was a little more comfortable than the previous one and we stayed there for a whole two weeks. We had two pitches next to each other and had a great time together. They even had a raclette grill as a surprise and we were able to eat raclette in front of their caravan. It was a dream to repeat. :heart_eyes:

After the two weeks, we made our way back to Germany together. We decided to take the toll-free roads again and made a stopover at *Château Camping de la Grange Fort.* This was an interesting campsite with a castle but unfortunately a bit loveless and run-down, maybe it was just because the season was already over. I don't know exactly, but it was fine for one night, even if it was too expensive for me.

The next morning we had to say goodbye as we didn't want to go straight to Germany. We planned another stopover in Dole at *Camping Du Pasquier.* We arrived at the perfect time, as there was a town festival and we got a free pitch on the campsite. In the evening we walked around the festival in the beautiful old town and had a great time at the end of our long journey.

It was hard to believe but now we were actually heading back to Germany. The next day we drove on to the German/French border and spent another night on French ground, the familiar motorhome site from April.

We walked to Breisach to have an ice cream. However, the weather wasn't great and we got back to the motorhome just in time for it to start raining.

The next day we drove to Eschbach to the parking space in the Breisgau business park because we had an appointment for the first inspection of the motorhome at Fiat Professional in Auggen the next morning.

Everything went perfectly and we were able to visit friends in Eschbach after the successful inspection. After two nights there, we drove back to the pitch in France, which is in a great location on the border with Breisach and has everything we need on site.

We used the time in our old home town to say goodbye to friends and family. We often spent the night right on their doorsteps, for example at my sister's and my mom's house.

We had invited my dad for dinner in Breisach, so we walked back to the motorhome in the evening. In the meantime, we also spent another night in Freiburg at the Hirzberg campsite, where I took advantage of the proximity to the city to have another beer with my former work colleagues. :beer:

After visiting everyone, we set off in the direction of Münster. Of course, we wanted to sell our motorhome there as quickly as possible. Luckily, I had already advertised our motorhome on mobile.de at the beginning of our trip and so I had a few interested people listed who I was able to contact after our arrival in Münster.

This later turned out to be a very wise decision. Nevertheless, we took our time and didn't hurry, driving the route in several stages.

The first stop was in Heidelberg at *Campingplatz Friedensbrücke.* It was wet and rainy but briefly dry and we took the bus to Heidelberg for lunch and had a look around the city until it started to rain again.

Next we drove to Wetzler and spent the night at the Lahninsel parking lot. Wetzlar also has a beautiful old town that is definitely worth a visit.

## Sale of the motorhome and the end of our road trip

At the end of our journey, we spent three nights at the *Pitch in Haltern am See.* These were also our last three nights in our own motorhome. It was a slightly sad feeling, but we knew that a new chapter in our lives would begin later.

The weather was mixed and we made the best of it.  After these three days, our motorhome journey of 8400 km ended in Münster and I spent the first two days completely emptying the motorhome. On the third day, I started cleaning the inside and outside, while at the same time making appointments with interested buyers. After the first appointment, the motorhome was already sold and the new owners are now very happy with this wonderful motorhome.

October was another very stressful month for us and we were very happy once we had finished everything. Nevertheless, we were able to switch off from time to time and enjoy the quality time with our friends in Münster. It is wonderful to have such friends and we are very grateful for that. Most of the weekends we had great food and drinks with nice get-togethers.

We had an incredibly great time that we will probably never forget in our lives. We lived in the motorhome for six months at a time and went to many different places. It was simply a dream and the decision to take this step was definitely worth it. Of course, I also hope that you enjoyed my 4 parts about our motorhome trip.

We have already left Germany. More about what we are doing now and where we are will be in a coming blog post. Until then, I hope you have a great time and I would be delighted if you would visit my blog again soon. It will definitely remain interesting.
