Last year we decided to travel on a longer trip with our motorhome. As we both loved seeing Portugal, it quickly became clear to us that we would first drive south along the Atlantic and then back to Germany along the Mediterranean.

Unfortunately, it will also be our last trip with the motorhome, as we have decided to sell it afterwards. :cry: The reasons for our decision will almost certainly be published here on my blog at some point.

We started on April 15, 2019 at home in Breisach am Rhein. However, that was just a practice run and getting ready for the trip with our two children. However, we always slept in the motorhome, either in our parking lot or in the immediate surrounding area with family or on a motorhome site in France.

## Departure to the motorhome dealer

We didn't actually set off until April 25, 2019 and first headed north to Öhringen to the motorhome dealer in Bretzfeld to have our leak test carried out and then to meet someone at the motorhome site in Öhringen.

Unfortunately, the weather wasn't particularly good and we drove on towards Münster on April 27 with an overnight stop.

We arrived in Münster on 28 April 2019 to visit friends of ours and take care of a few organizational issues. We also spent two days meeting other lovely people that I got to know through online marketing. We had previously leased the camping plot at the Münster campsite for a month, so we didn't travel further south until May 29, 2019.

## The journey with our motorhome begins

From then on, the actual road trip to Spain and Portugal began. However, we didn't set ourselves a schedule and generally didn't choose a site or campsite. A few days beforehand, I always checked the ACSI app to see which nice locations were around 200 km away and we drove to our favorite.

As it was off-season at the time, we were able to save a few bucks with the [ACSI Card](https://www.campingcard.com/). We often only paid 12 euros per night at the campsites, including electricity and showers with hot water.

We drove from Münster to the Netherlands and stayed one night at the motorhome site. The next morning we drove on to France via Belgium and stayed at another campsite for one night.

We visited several campsites in France, somehow we spent longer in France than I had imagined but it was beautiful anyway. At some point, of course, we also reached Spain and visited a few campsites again and the last one was even right on the Portuguese border, the Rio Mino river.

## Arrival in Portugal

Next, we drove over the bridge to Portugal and stayed a few kilometers further on at a campsite for two nights. After that, we only drove a few kilometers back because we were going to meet someone in the village.

We are currently still at this relatively large campsite, mainly with permanent campers and only a few tourist pitches, until probably Monday, July 1, 2019. After that, I would like to have our gas bottle refilled and stand in a free parking area in nature again.

We have planned to be on the road until the end of October 2019. So stay tuned and see you next time.

Best regards
Sebastian
