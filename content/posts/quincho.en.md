Our quincho is now finished and Stefanie's treatment room is also operational. A handful of little things are still missing, but more on that in a moment. As always, time passes very quickly here and another few months have passed.

With her new room, Stefanie now has even more appointments than before. Last year she could only arrange home visits and now with her own room it's a new level and the clients feel very comfortable. I'll show you a few more recent pictures of her treatment room in a moment.

## Treatment room for pain therapy

Once the quincho was almost finished, we first furnished the room. Stefanie of course set up her massage table and planned the furniture herself. A shelf with a ladder and a desk with wooden stands. She painted everything herself and I'll be finishing the shelves and table top for her soon. You can find the latest building progress [here](https://meinlifestylebusiness.com/der-neue-weg-von-unserem-haus-zum-quincho-ist-fertig/).

I also installed the lighting on the roof and walls as well as curtain rails and hung the curtains. This means that her treatment room was ready for use very quickly. She now does up to 4 treatments a day, whereas she used to limit herself to just 2 treatments a day. However, the new residents are quickly spreading the word and Stefanie regularly receives new requests, as everyone with pain wants to be treated by her or simply have a relaxing massage. Here are a few pictures of the Quincho and the treatment room:

Her pain therapy practice can also be found via Google Maps and Stefanie will certainly be pleased to receive a review from her satisfied customers:

## Finishing the quincho and outdoor kitchen

Unfortunately, we had to cancel the final work on the outdoor kitchen. So now we're still missing the insert for the grill and a functional oven. I'm going to start looking for them myself and try to find something suitable here in Paraguay. I'm already in contact with a few suppliers, so we'll see what comes out of that. Unfortunately, we can't use our outdoor kitchen at the moment.

However, we have bought a beautiful set of massive wooden table and benches and have already had our first party on Sofia's 6th birthday. To make the area around the quincho green again sooner, we had turf laid this time, which was still on offer at the moment. I think it was worth it and we are now watering it properly so that the lawn can grow well. Not easy in summer at 38Â°C, but luckily it rained again and it's supposed to rain again next Saturday.

That suits us just fine and otherwise we are optimizing the watering. We have a water pump and have been drawing water from our lake for watering since last year. We have a metal sprinkler and have ordered two more so that we don't have to water everything by hand. Maybe we'll automate the watering at some point? We only water the newly laid lawn and of course our young trees when it's dry, otherwise we let nature take care of itself.

My next job is to install the outdoor lighting around the room, where we have the same wall lights as inside. I also need to buy more electrical and network cables. We haven't laid any network cables to the room yet, so I'll have to do that myself, as well as the electrical cables for the outdoor lighting along the path to the patio extension. Only then will I build the lamps for it. However, I already have most of the material for the lamps here. That will be a lot of work again.

## New wooden rabbit hutch

Of course, we have now received the rabbit hutch we ordered and our two rabbits have been able to move into their new two-storey villa. The rabbit hutch has found its place behind the quincho between two bamboos and is therefore wonderfully protected from wind and weather. The long legs were actually intended to be buried in the ground. We didn't know this and we just tried leaving the rabbit hutch like this and what can I say, it's heavy enough and doesn't need to be dug in.

No storm has blown it over yet and the height is also perfect for accessing the rabbits. Foreign animals therefore have no chance of getting to our rabbits. When we mow the lawn, they are usually left free and are allowed to hop around our patio by the house so that they are not scared of the noisy lawnmower.

## Further work on the property

I made another request for the roof extension on the carport and we will soon receive a quote from a different builder. Unfortunately, we still hadn't received a quote after our first inquiry three months later. I assume that the second request will now be more successful and proceed faster. We need our roof extension urgently as our carport is now very crowded.

I usually like to build my furniture there because it's much more comfortable than in the workshop and it's not really possible at the moment. As soon as the roof extension is finished, I'll have more space again and all my vehicles and stuff will be protected from the strong sunlight and rain. I will continue to report and take care until then.

Kind regards
Sebastian
