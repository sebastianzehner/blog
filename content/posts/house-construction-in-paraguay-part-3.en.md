We have been living in Paraguay for more than nine months now and today there is another update on our house construction. This will probably be the last update, as I'm sure the next blog post will be called "Moving into our new house in Paraguay".

The construction work is almost complete and we are mainly still waiting for the electricity connection. This is estimated to take another four weeks, but as you know, everything can last longer in Paraguay.

In my [last blog post](/posts/house-construction-in-paraguay-part-2/), I reported that the roofers would soon be starting their work. Our roof ultimately took two weeks to complete, but the result is even more impressive. I really like the roof of our house, both inside and out, it's really beautiful.

After that, the interior work continued fast, especially now that nothing could get wet from the rain.

During this construction phase, we decided to make some minor upgrades from time to time. For example, we replaced the interior doors with coated panels by solid wooden doors or had the exposed brickwork additionally sealed to keep it looking good for longer. We opted for an exterior color other than white.

We have also selected the fittings for the bathrooms and the switch program for the electrical installation. The electrical installation still needs to be finalized, so we can start as soon as the material arrives. However, the cables have already all been pulled through the empty conduits. The taps also still need to be installed, but I have to build a wooden under-sink unit for the two sinks first.

Our waste water system, a Biodigestor, has already been installed on our property and connected to the house. We have also connected the water supply to the house. However, we would like to add a coarse filter in between, so the connection will be changed again as soon as the construction of the carport begins.

## Build our own furniture in Paraguay

I mentioned the other day that I want to build our own furniture. I visited a sawmill in Maciel a few weeks ago and was shown around the factory and the products, and was allowed to take a few samples with me. Unfortunately, I haven't received any exact prices yet, but I will be placing my order for the first projects soon.

These will include the beds, then the washstands and of course our kitchen. My tools should arrive in September and then I'll be able to get started.

We're really looking forward to furnishing our house and then finally being able to sit on our own terrace in peace. I can then show you more of our house and the property. You'll see how everything develops over the next few years. It's really starting to look like a small settlement where a few months ago there was only pasture.

## The next building contract has been signed

The planning of our entrance with the carport and the path around the house has been completed and I have already signed the plans. I also recently received the cost calculation and was therefore able to approve the start of the building work.

I'm excited to see when this final construction work will start. Of course, it would be nice if it could start next week. There is currently a lot of construction going on in our new settlement, but I think they will be able to finish the carport soon. It's just important to me that we have a proper entrance to our property and can walk to the house without getting wet.

## Our settlement keeps growing

It has not been possible to come to Paraguay for a long time, but this month over 30 new people from Germany, Austria and Switzerland are joining us. Among them are our direct neighbors who will live diagonally across from our lake.

They will now start planning their house and getting it built as soon as possible. I can't wait to see when they will be able to move in. We will have a construction site that we can watch from the terrace every day.

By the end of the year, we will probably have around 100 settlers in our settlement area, despite this crazy year. So many new houses have been built here in the settlement area over the last few months, even though construction has been halted and building materials have naturally become scarce.  

So the building sites here are still going ahead, which of course makes us pleased.

To round things off for today, I have a video of a drone flight over our house with the finished roof and its current state. Have fun while watching.

See you soon and best wishes from Paraguay by Sebastian
