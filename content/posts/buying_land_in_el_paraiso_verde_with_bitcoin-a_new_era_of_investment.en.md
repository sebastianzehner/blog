## A new era: Buying land with Bitcoin

In a world increasingly characterized by cryptocurrencies, El Paraiso Verde in Paraguay offers a pioneering opportunity:

Buy properties with Bitcoin now. This unique community combines cutting-edge technology with sustainable living and makes buying real estate easier, faster and more independent than ever before.

Why invest here?

El Paraiso Verde is more than just a place - it was born out of a vision for freedom, independence and sustainable living.

## My personal experience: The way to a new life

My journey with cryptocurrencies began in 2017 when I became aware of Bitcoin through my online marketing activities. It was an exciting year full of new experiences and I soon realized that Bitcoin is more than just a digital currency - it's a way to fundamentally change your life.

In 2019, I decided to quit my permanent job, even though I had really enjoyed it. However, our new life concept no longer left room for our usual work.

We discovered El Paraiso Verde back in 2017 and after an information week in March 2018, we were convinced: this was going to be our new home.

We sold our condominium in Germany, our garden plot and later even our beloved motorhome after taking it on an [unforgettable final trip through Europe](/categories/camping/).

In November 2019, we left our old life behind for good and moved directly to Paraguay with our young and small family to the wonderful El Paraiso Verde. Here we had a [house built on our property](/tags/el-paraiso-verde/) and created our own little paradise.

Without Bitcoin, we would probably never have dared to take this step. Cryptocurrencies gave us the financial flexibility and confidence to try something new - and it was the best decision of our lives.

## El Paraiso Verde: Freedom and community in Paraguay

El Paraiso Verde is the largest settlement project in South America with 14.23 square kilometers of land and 1711 plots with title, of which around 1100 can still be purchased. The rest have already been sold.

When you purchase a piece of land, you receive [an official land registry entry in Paraguay](/posts/title-in-el-paraiso-verde/) - a strong foundation for your investment.

The thriving community already includes over 100 completed houses, while almost 30 more are under construction (as of November 2024). People from all over the world come together here to freely shape their lives and fulfill their dreams.

Highlights of this gated community:

- **Freedom for families:** Our children grow up in a safe, free environment, discover new things in nature every day and learn at least two languages.
- **Individuality and respect:** The only restriction is respect for others and their lives: “Do not do to others what you would not want done to yourself.”
- **Sense of community:** We have met many new friends who share our values and vision.
- **Vision for the future:** El Paraiso Verde embodies John Lennon's “Imagine” - a life of love, peace, respect and harmony.
