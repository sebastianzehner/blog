In this blog post, I would like to report again on my interview from last year and also on our sightseeing flight over the settlement area in March 2022. I gave the interview in November 2021, after we had already been living in Paraguay for two years. Another six months have now passed. Time really does fly by here and I would like to show you my video of the sightseeing flight in a Cessna 210.

## After two years in El Paraiso Verde

We, my wife Stefanie and our two children Sofia and Liam, have been living in Paraguay since November 2019. In October 2020, we moved into our own house on Anastacia Circle. We are very happy with our decision and simply love living in our settlement, which we probably also owe to our fundamentally positive attitude. It wasn't always easy, you have to find your way around a new country first. I talk about this and other interesting topics in the following interview.

We got to know El Paraiso Verde at the end of 2017 and we only had two Skype conversations from Germany to get more information about the project and, above all, to find out whether we had any chance of building a new life there as a family. We bought a 2500 square meter plot of land directly with the option to swap at any time or, in the worst case, to give it back. In March 2018, we attended an information week and took a look at the project on site. Our first visit to Paraguay and the longest flight with my wife and our then one-year-old daughter.

Of course, there wasn't much to see at that time. There was no road leading to our plot and there were no finished buildings. The first buildings in Pira Tava were under construction. We stayed in a hotel in Caazapa and kept taking the bus to the estancia. We liked the project and the vision of Dr. Erwin and Sylvia Annau, we had confidence in the two founders and wanted to emigrate as soon as possible after the information week.

Of course, this took a while for us, depending on the initial situation, it is different for everyone. We were finally able to leave Germany in November 2019 and have been living in El Paraiso Verde in Paraguay ever since, building our own green paradise.

I can certainly go into a bit more detail when I get the chance and maybe write my own blog article about it if you're interested. But for now, take a look at my interview, where I tell you a lot about our story and you can also find out a bit about life on site.

## Our sightseeing flight from Caazapa airport over El Paraiso Verde

We had the opportunity to take part in a sightseeing flight. There are a few pilots in our settlement. This is of course a wonderful opportunity that we didn't want to miss. On March 5, 2022, we therefore had our first sightseeing flight in Paraguay with a Cessna 210. We took off from [Caazapa Airport](https://goo.gl/maps/JPCsb7HAPFjZK3xf7) to fly over [El Paraiso Verde](https://goo.gl/maps/9bLU4g9wGhMTBv5y8). We then returned to the airport with a total flight time of around 20 minutes.

More or less spontaneously, I had my little DJI Osmo Pocket camera with me. Unfortunately, I only recorded with the internal microphone, so I apologize for the poor audio quality in places. For a spontaneous video, however, the movie :tv: turned out quite interesting.
