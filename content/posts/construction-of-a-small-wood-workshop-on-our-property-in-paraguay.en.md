We are currently having a small workshop built. I had already taken this into account when building our carport, because at some point there was supposed to be a small room at the back that I could use as a workshop. It came sooner than planned because I really wanted to have a room where I could build our furniture in a more comfortable environment. A few weeks ago, I planned this small wooden workshop under our carport and placed the order after receiving the proposal.

## Construction has already started

A solid two weeks have now been spent working on this room, with Easter in between, and my little wooden workshop is now as good as finished. The correct power sockets were still missing and a few little things need to be reworked. Then the room can be cleaned and furnished by me. The workshop is actually nothing special, just a room with a floor area of 4m x 5m. A glass door and a window, of course with an electrical installation from power sockets to light switches, as well as outdoor lighting with motion detectors and air conditioning in case it gets too hot.

I think the workshop fits in beautifully with our house and property. It's a nice finish to the carport and I'm looking forward to being able to put all the tools and machines away. I'm hoping that this will make my work more relaxed, because until now I had all the tools in one room in the house and had to keep moving them back and forth as soon as I started working on our furniture. I also couldn't work in the rain, but in future that will certainly be possible in my own tiny workshop.

## Gardening around the workshop

In the last few days, we have already started to spread the delivered soil in the gaps. I had four large piles of soil in front of the house by the road. We crushed, removed and spread these over a longer period of time. We will soon be spreading this soil around the workshop as soon as the construction work is complete. We will then be able to plant some beautiful flowers and shrubs to further enhance the property.

## Connection prepared for an backup generator

In Paraguay, the power lines are laid overland and during storms it can happen that the power lines are damaged and then we have a power cut for a few hours. This has been relatively rare recently, but if you do have a power cut for a few hours, it can be annoying. Depending on what you're doing and what you're dependent on the power for.

From time to time, new houses get connected in our settlement or the power grid is extended, and then the power has to be switched off for a morning or afternoon. In Paraguay, this usually happens very spontaneously. We have therefore considered purchasing an backup generator to bridge this period for a short time if necessary.

We have made all the necessary preparations and will be able to set up and connect an backup generator in the rear area of the workshop at some point. It will then be operated in automatic mode. If the power fails, the backup generator will switch on automatically and we will have power again after a few seconds.

We have several uninterruptible power supplies with batteries (UPS) in the house, so this switchover time is also bridged and the devices run without interruption. As soon as the power from the local electricity provider is available again, this is recognized and automatically switched over. The backup generator then switches off automatically after a few seconds.

I'll get in touch again as soon as the workshop is ready for use. The electricity has now been installed, the power sockets installed and the air conditioning is also working. I still need to buy some lighting for inside and two LED spotlights with motion detectors for outside. I'll then furnish the workshop and we can continue.

Kind regards
Sebastian
