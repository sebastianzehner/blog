The time here in Paraguay is flying by, even though it’s actually a very peaceful and relaxing place. We already have a lot to do again and are quite busy.

I’m working on several projects, and today I’d like to share with you another little update about our life in Paraguay. The last time I updated you was through [Moving into our new house in Paraguay](/posts/move-into-our-new-house-in-paraguay/).

## What has changed during this time?

We planted more trees. Unfortunately, some of them have died, while others are growing very well. We’re just trying a lot of different things out since we’re not professionals in this area.

We have mostly dealt with and distributed the pile of earth between the house and the road; soon we will also plant some trees there. Stefanie will make a list this weekend of the trees we would like to order. I think we will plant them the following week.

We also planted vegetation in the strip of land between the house and the carport. The hibiscus has grown quite well again recently, after having been completely eaten by leafcutter ants. Lately, we haven’t had any more problems with leafcutter ants; I hope this will continue. A few days ago, Stefanie planted some more shrubs next to the carport.

## Furniture manufacturing in Paraguay, with our own workshop

Our carport is currently undergoing renovations. Over the past few weeks, I worked on designing the layout for my workshop and submitted the plans on Monday. Since Tuesday, the construction workers have been working to build the space beneath the carport for me.

Things are progressing quickly, and I’m excited when the workshop is finished. Then I’ll be able to organize everything and continue with the furniture construction. I’m really glad we made this decision; it already looks amazing, and I can’t wait until it’s all done.

By the way, in the meantime I also received the eucalyptus solid wood that I had ordered. That was another whole story… :see_no_evil: In the end, we had to start all over again at the beginning of the year. I was given a list of the standard dimensions that are always available, and now I can place orders for them whenever I need them.

A one-week delivery time – if I still want to have both sides of the item freshly machined. Of course, I’m very satisfied that I’ve found a good supplier as well.

Of course, the furniture-making process itself progressed slowly anyway, because I kept having to assemble and disassemble my materials and tools. In the meantime, I cut the pieces for the cabinets under the washbasins and have already assembled some of them.

Our floating bed is 90% finished; all the parts are made from solid wood. I just need to install the panels, apply some oil, and install the indirect lighting. The parts for the children’s bunk bed have all been cut out and some of them have already been sanded. The construction of the furniture will continue once my workshop is ready.

## Back online and active with my online business again?

Otherwise, I’m currently participating in a lot of Skype conversations and am getting involved with a new cryptocurrency project. So I’ll become more active again with my online business and not just rely on passive income.

I once again feel more motivated to help other people escape from that cycle of endless hardship, so that they might also be able to lead a life of freedom. I’ve noticed that many people have even less freedom since last year, and of course, this situation must be changed.

We feel very comfortable here in El Paraiso Verde, Paraguay. I am extremely grateful that we took this step. Most of all, I am happy that we stood up for our rights and fought for our freedom.

We took the plunge and seized the opportunities as they came along. We stopped making any excuses and just focused on moving forward with determination. Looking back on all the things we’ve experienced over the past few years… *it’s simply incredible and absolutely priceless.*

I wish you a wonderful time and see you soon!

Best regards,  
Sebastian
