**Take action - Seize your ‚Äúonce-in-a-lifetime opportunity‚Äù now! Invitation to our confidential presentation.**

Have you ever imagined turning an investment of 30,000 USD into 450,000 USD in just 18 months? This is not unusual for large investors, but for everyone else it is a world closed off. That's changing now!

## Why act now? The financial world of today:

The euro is falling and falling:

- Against the dollar
- Against gold
- Against Bitcoin

**Conclusion:** Your money in the bank, or in a financial investment? An endangered species.

## Your investments - and why you should rethink

**Do you have large sums in bank deposits?**
Congratulations on your optimism, but you are impoverishing yourself, because bank deposits are always subject to inflation and your investment loses a massive amount of purchasing power.

**Have you invested in Bitcoin?**
If you invested at the right time, congratulations, but do you really believe that the Bitcoin price will be worth ten or fifteen times as much in the next 18 months, i.e. around 900,000 ‚Äì 1,300,000 USD?

**Are you invested in stocks?**
Good idea if you were just lucky enough to be in a stock like Facebook, Google or Amazon at the very beginning, because the highest profits are made at the beginning. And on today's basis, even with Facebook and Co, a 10-15x price increase in 18 months is illusory.

## What to do? Here is the alternative:

PRE- IPO stocks of ‚Äúbrick and mortar‚Äù companies, meaning companies that produce real goods (not digital).

IPOs (Initial Public Offerings) historically offer the best opportunities for a multiplication of your investment.

Technology companies that have come to market as "first movers" with trend-setting technologies have successfully implemented almost all of their IPOs on the stock exchange and turned small investors into multimillionaires time and again in just a few years.

## Question: Who has produced the most dollar millionaires worldwide?

No, NOT Amway, Siemens or BMW, but Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Tesla and many, many others ‚Äì all companies that were the first on the market with groundbreaking new technologies.

For a short time, we are offering you exactly this opportunity:

By buying shares in a technology company before its IPO, your investment can increase in value by a factor of 15 in about 18-24 months.

## Is such an increase in value realistic at all?

Of course! There are many examples of this: Oracle, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Amazon, Coca Cola...

The important word is **PRE**-IPO. Once a stock is listed on the stock exchange (NYSE or NASDAQ), there is still potential for an increase in value for many years afterwards, but it is pre-market that matters (‚Äúwhere the jazz is being played...‚Äù)

## Your profit plan after the IPO

- At IPO: 10% profit
- After 6 months: Another 20%
- After 12 months: Another 30 %
- After 18 months: Your shares will be freely saleable.

What are you going to do with these high revenues if they are being paid out from mid-2026 to the end of 2027?

- Withdraw money and travel all over the world? Great car?
- Invest into a valuable real estate?
- Realize your dream home or your life's dream, whatever it might be?

## Important message to **all** Bitcoin investors!

Particularly exciting: These stocks can be bought with Bitcoin. An investment that combines traditional and modern approaches to offer you maximum flexibility.

## My personal strategy for years

I haven't had any money in the bank for a long time. I started with cryptocurrencies in 2017 and moved to Paraguay with my family in 2019. We use some cash for everyday life but otherwise we have our capital tied up in tangible assets and cryptocurrencies.

Now I recently heard about this new exciting IPO and was in a Zoom meeting myself a few days ago to get this information and I will not miss this promising opportunity.

I have decided to invest part of the price gains with Bitcoin (ATH in December 2024) in these technology shares and would like to give my readers the opportunity to obtain this information without obligation in order to make a decision afterwards.

I strongly assume that no more PRE- IPO shares of this company will be available in the next few months and that you will only be able to buy these shares again after the IPO. **So it's all the more worth being early this time!**

## How can you participate?
