During our motorhome road trip to Spain :es: and Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹, we would of course also like to have access to fast and decent internet. I looked at a few options beforehand but didn't know how and whether everything would run so well abroad. In the end, we used a very good option in Spain :es: which we are now using.

Of course, we have our smartphones with the German SIM cards with us and nowadays roaming in the EU no longer costs anything extra. However, German rates for mobile Internet are relatively expensive and usually limited.

We both have prepaid cards from [congstar](https://www.congstar.de/) and I pay 10 euros a month for an Allnet Flat and 1.5GB data volume. This can be used without any problems in other European countries ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º, but the 1.5GB is not enough for me for very long.

In Germany, we also used the GigaCube from Vodafone with the prepaid plan for 35 euros a month and 50GB data volume. I once wrote about this in a blog post, as we mainly bought it for the garden at the time.

Unfortunately, Vodafone doesn't allow roaming on this plan, so we can't use it abroad either.

## Mobile Internet abroad thanks to Simyo Spain

The solution for this is a Spanish SIM card from [Simyo](https://www.simyo.es/) with a prepaid plan, which also works without any problems in our GigaCube and we have super-fast Internet in Spain.

I chose the option with 28GB data volume for 17 euros a month. I think we're doing quite well with it and we can also use the card in Portugal, as Simyo allows roaming on this plan.

There are various stores where you can get a SIM card from Simyo. I went to a [BEEP Shop](https://www.beep.es/) and they helped me very well. I was able to speak English with the sales clerk and he even had my SIM card activated by Simyo.

To do this, you have to make a phone call to Simyo in Spanish. However, not all BEEP stores are the same, as I realized, because in the first store I was turned away or the saleswoman did not want to accept my German identity card.

In my opinion, another important point is worth mentioning, because with this plan you are not only surfing at LTE speed, but you can also continue to use unused data volume the next month.

In Germany, unused data volume usually expires at the end of the month to the disadvantage of the customer, as it was paid for.

## Unfortunately there are two cons with Simyo Spain

German customers with this plan have a minor disadvantage. We cannot officially download the Spanish Simyo app from the Google Play Store, as we are not allowed to install this app with the German region setting on Google.

However, there is a way to download this app outside the Google Play Store and then install it manually. You can then use the Spanish app to access your subscription and see the available data volume at any time.

Another disadvantage is that you can top up your prepaid card in the Simyo app, but unfortunately no German credit cards are accepted. But there is a solution for this too. I recharge my credit via the service [recharge.com](https://www.recharge.com/) worldwide.

To recharge, you select the provider on the website and enter your phone number, then you can select the amount and pay with any credit card. Unfortunately, this costs a service fee of 99 cents, but the balance is available immediately and as long as you are in Spain, you can of course buy credits locally in the stores or usually also at the gas stations.

So far, I am absolutely satisfied with this solution. The Internet is fast, cheap and works perfectly in our motorhome with the WLAN router and all our devices have access to the Internet.

What else could you want? Usually the WLAN on pitches or campsites is extremely slow and often expensive. That's why you are always flexible and have access to the Internet with your own mobile connection.

Kind regards
Sebastian
