## Less stuff and more plain text - make it simple and efficient

Yesterday, I thought that something has to change with my old website. I had a wordpress blog since years and my last post was written one year ago. I did more updates and bugfixes in this time than writing new interesting posts. Above all it cost money and time to operate. My first idea was to go back to the 90s. So what's about a simple plain text website? Let the focus return to the plain text in a post. In a world full of web apps, cookies and tracking tools, social media and multimedia distraction it's well to know that there are still some websites online which use simple plain text.

I searched the internet after templates and how to build a simple and minimalistic website with plain text nowadays. I found some interesting websites and memories came up because I know these websites from the past. But I also want to post some pictures or embed a youtube video on my space. I decided that it should be a modern and simple website just right for today.

## How to build a new modern website for free?

How to build this website without a software? Use the simple text editor or what? How to manage the simplicity in a modern technical way? I know it and I will share this knowledge with you in the next post on this website. I am using right now Hugo with the PaperMod theme and this all is completely free. It costs me $0 because Hugo and PaperMod are open source and free to download. Even the webhosting is free and I will show you how this works. Only if you want to use your own domain name then you have to pay something for the domain.

I am happy with this decision because now I have a new modern and minimalistic website for free and it's my own project to develop. I want to write more posts in the future and I want to merge the posts from my old wordpress blog to this new website. Sure only the most popular posts and I want to translate all posts from German to English because I also decided to write in English when I use my new website. I want to leave my comfort zone again and learn or improve other languages. I think that I will also translate this website to Spanish because I live in Paraguay since 2019 and here the most locals speak Spanish. This website was entirely build in only one single day. It's that simple and I like how to use it.

## What's up next on this new website?

I have much more ideas to develop this website with a little more technical stuff but keep it simple everytime. In future I will write exactly about this technical stuff and other projects like Ai content or our off-grid solar system which I have to build in the next few month. Also I will write furthermore about our beautiful life in Paraguay. We live in a secure Gated Community called El Paraiso Verde. Be sure I am happy to share all my knowledge with the people in the world wide web. This is enough for today I think :grin:

Regards
Sebastian
