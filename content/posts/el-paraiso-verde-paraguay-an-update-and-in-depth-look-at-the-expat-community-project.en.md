It was a symbolic moment: When the old El Paraiso Verde sign was taken down and removed, a chapter that had shaped our shared life for many years visibly came to an end. This video of the moment shows more than just the removal of a sign – it represents a fresh start, an opportunity to learn from past mistakes, and a chance to rebuild our community on a new, honest, and transparent foundation.

## A Current Report on the Developments in Our Settlement

Those who have followed [my articles](https://sebastianzehner.com/tags/el-paraiso-verde/) know that we emigrated to Paraguay in November 2019. For six years now, my family and I have been living in the (former) settlement of El Paraiso Verde in Caazapá. We built our house here and, in 2024, finally received the [title for our property](https://sebastianzehner.com/posts/title-in-el-paraiso-verde/) – an important step that has provided legal security for the life’s work of many of us.

I have long refrained from sharing this information publicly. The reason was that all legal steps first had to be completed to ensure that no unfounded accusations were made against others. This responsible handling of facts is precisely what distinguishes us from those who criticized and defamed. Now that the legal situation has been clarified, I would like to share these developments openly and transparently with my readers.

## Beginning of the Critical and Partially Defamatory Posts

In early 2023, critical and partially defamatory posts about our community began to circulate more frequently on social media. According to our research, their origin can be traced to a Telegram group called “Fraud in Paraguay,” started by a person named Tom S. Coincidentally, he is an administrator for the real estate agent Uwe H. in Paraguay.

The first major incident occurred on May 30, 2023, when a user named Mike M. posted messages in that group containing serious accusations against the founders:

> Mike M. publicly accused the founders of fraud, named individuals, and threatened legal action. These accusations are not confirmed by us and are part of a smear campaign that caused great uncertainty within the community.

Due to the highly offensive, aggressive, and in some cases threatening nature of these posts, I have decided not to publish their exact wording. Doing so would only harm readers unnecessarily and distract from an objective account of the events.

Oviedo Press published a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJgc55veU8E) containing accusations against the founders and the settlement project. Since the individuals in question merely purchased a plot of land, while we have lived here for six years, these allegations do not reflect the reality we have experienced. Another [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARnkONnlG10) clarified the facts and refuted the claims.

From that point on, the campaign escalated: insults, unfounded accusations, and targeted disinformation began to spread. Settlers who remained loyal to the founders were blocked in chats – in some cases by outsiders or competing real estate agents.

## The Truth About the Founders

We remain in good contact with the founders of the project to this day. Based on everything we know, there is no evidence of fraud committed by the founders. However, legal proceedings are currently underway against the former chairman of the operating company.

## A Familiar Pattern

During my research, I came across the story of the Neufeld Colony, whose course shows remarkable parallels to our situation. In our case as well, a group of settlers – including a former board member – joined forces with lawyers and a newly founded association to begin agitating against the founders.

Although the association’s website emphasizes anonymity, a closer technical analysis of the site structure and linked documents reveals the real names of some of the participants.

In the imprint, one finds the note: “Name: anonymous for security reasons, as long as the company at this location disciplines its creditors with firearms.” However, this statement is an unsubstantiated claim that in no way reflects the actual circumstances. Based on our experience, there is no indication of any such threat or use of violence.

## Evidence from Personal Experience

Some time ago, I published several videos on my YouTube channel in which I ride my motorcycle through the surrounding area — including both leaving and returning to the settlement. These recordings were made independently of the current discussion and show everyday life on site as it truly is.

The videos clearly demonstrate that there is no sense of threat or tension. Interactions with the guards are friendly and respectful — people know and greet each other. This directly contradicts the unfounded claims of supposed “violence” or “disciplinary measures.”

- [By motorcycle to Caazapá for fuel, the ATM, and then to the new bridges](https://youtu.be/4yy83aLqHFo)

These previously published videos therefore provide an authentic picture of the actual situation on the ground. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the opposing portrayals — both in the imprint and in various articles of the association, such as in the so-called “Follies of Therese M.” — were deliberately staged or distorted to cast the El Paraiso Verde project and its settlers in a negative light.

## Ecopolis – The Questionable Renaming of the Project

At one point, a renaming of the settlement was considered, and trademark registrations were filed under the name “Ecopolis.”  
Since the land is owned by a variety of parties — including private individuals, the operating company, and a major investor — it remains unclear on what legal basis an association could even seek to pursue such a renaming.

## Comparison with Neufeld

During my research, I also visited the website of the association [Campo Nuevo Neufeld](https://www.colonianeufeld.com/). The factual counterpositions presented by [Asocia Reinland](https://x.com/AsociaReinland/status/1804679556432859191) on X.com, as well as the website of the [Alpha Association](https://www.alpha-assoziation.de/), made it clear to me that similar challenges have occurred in other community projects as well.

The documents published there convinced me: the Alpha board recognized the underlying issues and has been consistently advocating for truth and justice. Many of the mechanisms described there are disturbingly similar to what we experienced in the former El Paraiso Verde.

## Land Titles and Forensic Evidence

During the smear campaign, we gradually received our land titles in 2024 — a clear indication that the allegations of fraud were unfounded. I wrote in detail about the title issuance [here](https://sebastianzehner.com/posts/title-in-el-paraiso-verde/).

By that time, the former board had already left the project, abandoning the community without resources. Despite this, we stood together, helped with the rebuilding, and gathered evidence. The [forensic report](https://paraiso-verde.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/04-Dictamen-pericial.pdf) confirmed that it was not the founders but the former administration who had misappropriated funds.

## Judicial Intervention and Stalemate

Shortly before the indictment, a court-appointed administrator was installed — as [Wochenblatt reported](https://wochenblatt.cc/el-paraiso-verde-gericht-setzt-mit-grossem-polizeiaufgebot-neuen-geschaeftsfuehrer-ein/). This measure rendered the founders unable to act. Since then, payments have been frozen, invoices remain unpaid, and the future of many settlers is uncertain. Observers within the community expressed concern that the operating company could face financial instability as a result of these developments.

The twelve shareholders who enabled this intervention are known by name, though the documentation has not been made publicly available. Some on-site observations were recorded, but without any direct assignment of blame.

The 13 open questions directed at the involved shareholders (listed below) are presented as ongoing research — intended to shed light on the sequence of events without making premature judgments.

## Suspicion of External Influence

There are indications and observations suggesting that certain actors may be attempting to exert influence over the settlement. Possible political support for these actions has neither been confirmed nor ruled out.

Many residents already hold their land titles, while others do not — which could lead to uncertainty. It remains possible that the remaining plots of land could, in the future, be managed differently, similar to what has been observed in the Neufeld community.

## Between Truth and Division

Those of us who continue to maintain daily operations do so out of conviction and, in most cases, voluntarily. Unfortunately, some of the people who offer help within the community are being isolated or criticized.

My goal is to present facts transparently — without creating division or defaming anyone.

## Looking Ahead

I will likely publish further articles on this topic in the future and report on new developments. My wish remains the same: **clarity, justice, and peace.**

Trust has been shaken, but understanding and reconciliation could be the first steps toward a new beginning. Despite all setbacks, we continue to work on strengthening our community and preserving the values that brought us here.

> **Note:** This article is based on personal research, publicly available sources, and firsthand experiences. All statements have been made to the best of my knowledge but do not represent a conclusive legal assessment.

The events of recent times have shown how essential clear values and mutual respect are for living together in a community. Instead of allowing ourselves to be influenced by negative voices, we focus on constructive progress and cooperation. Only on this foundation can trust be rebuilt and a stable, forward-looking community emerge.

Best regards,  
Sebastian

## Open Questions to Shareholders (Abbreviated)

1. “Is it merely a coincidence that the _Poder_ was issued on September 15, 2025, while on the same day Forensic Report No. 48/2025 — documenting the withdrawals — was submitted?”
2. “Why are certain former participants not mentioned in this _Poder_?”
3. “How can the timing of an embargo against Congressman Avelino Davalos be explained?”
4. “Why did Davalos’ attorney request shortly after the police intervention that the attorney representing the operating company withdraw from further proceedings?”
5. “Could the newly appointed administrator have reached an agreement with Davalos?”
6. “Why was a special police unit deployed when other legal measures would have been possible?”
7. “Were there contacts or external influences that could explain this operation?”
8. “Was this approach intended to exert pressure on specific parties?”
9. “Why was a police officer involved who reportedly held a real estate mortgage?”
10. “Could certain actors have influenced the shareholders while the shareholders themselves financed the operation?”
11. “What motivation lies behind the agitation of former settlers and investors?”
12. “How is it possible that civilians appeared to have been informed in advance and took advantage of the situation?”
13. “The court order is set to last six months — who ensures that payments are maintained during and after this period?”

## Lack of Answers to Key Questions

As of today (October 16, 2025), I have not received any response to the questions I raised. These questions were shared both in the internal settlers’ chat and publicly under a related video that included a statement from a lawyer.

Several settlers repeated my questions in the chat and also requested clarification — yet there has been no reaction from those responsible. While silence may not officially count as a response, in this context it can certainly be seen as a telling sign.
