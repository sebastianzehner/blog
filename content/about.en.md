|Welcome to my personal blog. My name is Sebastian Zehner and I am the founder and owner of sebastianzehner.com|![Sebastian](/img/galleries/about/sebastian.webp)|

I created a blog in 2014 for the following reasons: At that time, I was looking for a change and other people with motivation who wanted to share ideas about making money online, were tired of their usual job or simply wanted more from their life.

I was passionate about starting my lifestyle business at that time. I searched for help on the internet and found some interesting people and opportunities. At first I learned that you need your own blog and an automated marketing system to make money online.

It all seemed very exciting to me, so I started with a ready-to-use blog system, combined with a marketing training course from the United States. We even flew to Las Vegas in 2015 and participated in a live event. That was the starting point and the motivation for a new life. Over the years, I have continued to improve my skills and there have also been some positive changes. In 2016, I created my own blog with WordPress and since July 2024, this blog has changed. I no longer use WordPress but instead Hugo with the PaperMod theme. I have of course transferred the most popular blog articles from the older blog systems.

In 2016, my girlfriend at this time (now wife) and I still enjoyed driving our small caravan through Germany and Europe quite a lot. If we didn't want to travel with the caravan, we could go to our small garden with a garden house. This was also a common project on which we had a lot of fun and spent our spare time.

I've written a few blog posts about our travels with the caravan, but also about our garden and how it was developed. At the beginning of 2015, our garden house was largely finished and we started to build the garden.

I would be glad if my story inspires you to find new methods to create a better life, to have more time for the people and things that are really important to you and to just do what you personally enjoy.

But before I tell you how I and our team make money online, I want to take the opportunity to tell you how I came to build an internet and lifestyle business and how I want to help and empower other people to do the same.

## How did everything start?

I was born in Freiburg im Breisgau in 1983 and grew up in the Kaiserstuhl region. Even as a child, I had the feeling that the knowledge we were taught at school wouldn't really help me in life. Nevertheless, I passed my secondary school and my professional training as a communications electronics technician specializing in information technology with a very good average grade.

I was then offered a permanent position at the company where I successfully completed my professional training. I ended up working there for another six years until one day, overnight, it was announced that our entire division was being closed down and sold abroad. A few months later, we were transferred to a transfer company and I used this time to continue my further education. Successful people like to learn or learn new skills. I still take this to heart today.

During this phase, I thought about what I wanted to do next as a professional. In short, I thought about becoming self-employed and started looking for the right business opportunity. As I came from the consumer electronics sector for development and customer support and my former work colleague was also looking for a new challenge, we came together and founded a GbR.

Since then, our task has been to offer customers antenna systems and install them on site, and we have also offered and very successfully implemented IT solutions and building automation. Business was going really well, but after two years I realized that it couldn't go on like this. We were working non-stop, day and night, even at weekends, and our manpower was always in demand. As soon as you have positioned yourself as an expert here, it becomes difficult to continue this with your own employees, as you always had to be on site yourself. I didn't see any other option at the time and switched back to permanent employment and now worked in quality assurance at a medical technology company.

Of course, I was aware that I would now earn much less and have a 40-hour week in which I would always have to be available for the company to do the tasks assigned to me in my employment contract.

If I were to continue doing this until retirement age, my future would probably look less relaxed because I just expect more from my life. That's why I decided to go back to self-employment on a part-time basis, but this time to set up the business completely differently. I had previously read the book [The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich](https://amzn.to/3HXmAFN) by Timothy Ferriss, in which I learned about automating your own business for the first time.

I was so fascinated by this that I wanted to follow the same path. But which business idea would fit in best? I would have to develop my own product and sell it. But what could I develop in the short time available and could I even find a product that would fit? It was clear to me that there had to be another solution for the time being.

As a result, I found a way that is professional and simple genius for me to build a business on the Internet in this day and age. The solutions are called affiliate marketing, internet marketing, video marketing, attraction marketing and blogging. All in all, a modern marketing strategy that makes it possible to build up several passive incomes without having to sell anything directly.

## When were the first successes?

So far, my lifestyle business has mainly been part-time and I still had my main job at a medical technology company in quality assurance. However, this was becoming increasingly unpleasant and stressful from time to time, mainly because of the poor working atmosphere. So, for the first time in my life, I quit a " safe" job without having another job. It was a big and unfamiliar step for me, but it felt really good and was important for my further development. I was almost ready to quit completely and not take another job at all.

However, there was another interesting opportunity for a job that I started in 2016. But it was different than before. I was employed in a small family business and basically had an entire department for myself. I planned and installed alarm systems, video surveillance and digital access control. I was on site with the customers, advised them, wrote offers, ordered and installed the systems, wrote invoices and did the maintenance. It was a very interesting job and I learned a lot and had fun along the process. I would probably still be there today if something drastic hadn't changed in my life, but more about that later.

I got my first cryptocurrencies at the beginning of 2017 and have been very enthusiastic about them ever since. That was probably also the breakthrough for my lifestyle business and 2017 was also a very eventful year for me and my family. Our daughter was born, we got married after 16 years, we bought a large motorhome, we thought about emigrating and planned our first trip to South America.

## New plans for the future

After a very successful year, the crypto market collapsed in 2018. I was still very new and inexperienced in this area, but I stayed calm and just stayed calm. In March 2018, all three of us flew to Paraguay and applied for the cedula and permanent residence permit. We weren't yet sure whether we would actually emigrate, but we took a look at a new settlement that was being built in Paraguay at this time.

We had just bought our new large motorhome and wanted to experience a few more trips with it, but the desire to emigrate and start somewhere new was still strong. Back in Germany, we made a plan. We actually decided to emigrate and sell our apartment and garden.

We didn't want to sell the motorhome straight away, plus my wife was pregnant again and we wanted to get our second child in Germany too, as everything went so well with the first birth. Our plan now was to sell the apartment but to be allowed to live there until we move into the motorhome about two to three months after the birth and go on a trip through Europe for six months.

So I quit my regular job again, which I had actually really enjoyed, but I had no other choice when it came to a new life in Paraguay. After the birth of our son in February 2019, I went on parental leave and never returned. Since then, I haven't had a job or a stable income. This was unimaginable for me before, but we've been living like this for a few years now and somehow it seems to be working. It's now July 2024 and over five years have actually passed in that time.

Our plan at the beginning was perfect and we stayed on a campsite in Münster for a month to say goodbye to our dearest and long-time friends. We then began our final tour via Belgium to France. Our destination was the Algarve in Portugal and so we drove on through Spain, always along the coast. Later we continued via Gibraltar along the coast in the south back to Germany. I wrote a few blog articles about our motorhome trip.

## Move to Paraguay

Back in Germany, we sold our motorhome and flew to Paraguay. We have now been living in Paraguay since November 2019 and have created our own paradise in a gated community. I have already written a few blog articles about the development and will certainly write more articles about our life in Paraguay. There will be more details about why we moved and left Germany.

We now have our own property and house here and Stefanie even has her own treatment room for pain therapy. I have a woodworking shop and build our own furniture. We have all the freedom we need here on site and I will be able to continue working online over the internet. Of course, I'm not going to sell you anything at this point, but maybe I'll inspire you and you'll pluck up the courage to change your life in a different and positive direction?

If you are already settled and everything is going perfectly in your life, then I am of course very glad if I can still inspire and above all entertain you with our articles. You can find all blog articles about our life in Paraguay here.
